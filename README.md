# Skincare Recommendation System

This project aims to develop a skincare recommendation system that suggests suitable skincare products based on a user's skin type, concerns, and preferences. The system employs similarity indexing techniques to match users with relevant products from a database.

## Features

- **Ingredient Preferences**: Users can specify preferred ingredients they want to include or exclude from the recommended products.
- **Product Recommendations**: The system suggests skincare products (cleansers, moisturizers, serums, etc.) based on the user's inputs, using similarity indexing to match their ingredients with product characteristics.
- **Product Details**: Users can view detailed information about the recommended products, ingredients, and ratings.
